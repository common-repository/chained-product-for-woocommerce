== Short Description ==

Create captivating product bundles with customizable options, discounts, and promotions to boost sales and engage customers.

== Description ==

Add your product as chain with discount type(%,fixed,same price,free),also with min , max quantity and quantity type (fixed,linked).

Why invest in separate plugins for WooCommerce grouped products when Chained Products can manage most of these - bundles, composites, assemblies, packages, etc., in a way that boosts cart success. Select the primary product, link products to it, and create irresistible custom product bundles.

This product bundle plugin has been a favorite for thousands of stores over the past decade due to its ease of use and flexibility. Here's how it functions:

Store owners can "chain" (attach) as many products as they want (with varying quantities if necessary) to an existing or new product, which we'll refer to as the "primary" product.
When a customer purchases this "primary" product, they pay the price of the "primary" product but receive all the "chained" products automatically. They will also see the "chained" products in their cart and order. The chained products can also have individual pricing. For instance, if a laptop is your primary product, items like a wireless mouse, keyguard, cleaning kit, and extended warranty could be chained to it.
The Chained Products plugin effortlessly manages variable products, subscriptions, multi-level nested offers, pricing, access to virtual products and discount application. It's compatible with popular themes.
